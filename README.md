  <summary>1. Introduction </summary>

Django follows the MVT design pattern (Model View Template).

- Model - The data you want to present, usually data from a database.
- View - A request handler that returns the relevant template and content - based on the request from the user.
- Template - A text file (like an HTML file) containing the layout of the web page, with logic on how to display the data.

Model <br>

The model provides data from the database.

- In Django, the data is delivered as an Object Relational Mapping (ORM), which is a technique designed to make it easier to work with databases.

- The most common way to extract data from a database is SQL. One problem with SQL is that you have to have a pretty good understanding of the database structure to be able to work with it.

- Django, with ORM, makes it easier to communicate with the database, without having to write complex SQL statements.

- The models are usually located in a file called models.py.

View

- A view is a function or method that takes http requests as arguments, imports the relevant model(s), and finds out what data to send to the template, and returns the final result.

- The views are usually located in a file called views.py.

Template

- A template is a file where you describe how the result should be represented.

- Templates are often .html files, with HTML code describing the layout of a web page, but it can also be in other file formats to present other results, but we will concentrate on .html files.

- Django uses standard HTML to describe the layout, but uses Django tags to add logic.

- The templates of an application is located in a folder named templates.

```html
<h1>My Homepage</h1>

<p>My name is {{ firstname }}.</p>
```

URLs

- Django also provides a way to navigate around the different pages in a website.

- When a user requests a URL, Django decides which view it will send it to.

- This is done in a file called urls.py.
